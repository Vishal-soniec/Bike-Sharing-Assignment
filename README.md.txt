# Project Name
Programming Assignment to build Multiple Linear Regression Model for prediction of demand for shared bike.


## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


## Conclusions
We can see that the equation of our best fitted line is:

𝑐𝑛𝑡 = 0.22×𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛 − 0.2175×𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 − 0.1564×ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑦 − 0.2540×𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑡 − 0.1174+0.5271 - Based on Manual but doesnt look linear
cnt = 0.4987 - 0.2785*spring -0.0904*Dec - 0.0276*Feb - 0.1166*Nov - 0.0756*Mist + 0.2522*yr Based on RFE

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0
